#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having different versions on different platforms is not desired, Pipfile.lock should be ignored.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for libraries, as it ensures deterministic builds.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having different versions on different platforms is not desired, poetry.lock should be ignored.
